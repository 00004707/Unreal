Personal docs of Unreal Engine, made in a short and visual manner.

Key principles
###########################

* Definitions should be as short as possible - a single sentence or animated image.
* Definitions should contain at least one image. Avoids "where the hell is that button"
* Hotlinking to other websites should be avoided - websites die, change or suck.
* Has to load quickly, webp + webm

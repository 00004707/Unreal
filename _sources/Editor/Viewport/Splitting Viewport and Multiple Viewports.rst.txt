===================================================

Splitting into areas (Viewport Layouts)
--------------------------------------------

Viewport can be split to multiple areas to make placing actors easier or provide multiple points of view. 

| Viewports with view mode set to ortographic are synchronized between same viewport window.

    Viewport layouts are located inside of ``Viewport Options`` menu

Multiple viewport windows
-------------------------

Unreal Engine allows creating up to 4 viewport windows. Each of them can be split in up to 4 more viewport areas.

    Extra viewports are avaiable in ``Window`` menu located in menu bar.

.. note::

    Each open viewport is going to put extra strain on your system and might slow editor down. 

.. note::
    
    Use ``Unlit`` or ``Wireframe`` view mode to make viewport window significantly less resource heavy. See :ref:`viewport_modes`
